- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @wgryman1978
- ðŸ‘€I have learned that coding is quite interesting in Python and have been working trial and error on my own small business accounting package to manage income, expences, tax calculations and wages(costs and on-costs, not STP).
- I have been coding since January this year (2022) and have been slowly teachingmyself PySimpleGUI, SQLite3, Openpyxl, pandas and several other python libraries.
- I am averaging around 6 to 10 hours per week between research and code writing.
- I am always open to suggestion and willing to do the hard yards necessary to achieve my program. It wont beat me!
